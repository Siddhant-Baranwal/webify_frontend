# Webify: 
A site for learning web development for the beginners. 
This is the frontend repo of the project. 
[Link](https://github.com/Siddhant-Baranwal/webify_backend.git) to the backend repo.
[This](https://webify-gold.vercel.app/) is the actual site.

## Idea:
The basic idea of this website is to give the beginners a platform where they get the roadmap for full-stack web development. The user gets a 7 step roadmap for different tools of web-development. The user can click on that and see the useful videos and documentation for learning that tool, and also some videos for making a sample project using those and the previous tools. We have also tried to make the overall look of the site technical and futuristic and added cool gifs and animation at each part where we thought of.

## Implementation and Tech Stacks used:
The website is build on ReactJS. We have used different components for home page, navigation bar, counselling page and donate page.

## Our team:
