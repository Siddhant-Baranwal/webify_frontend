# Webify: 
A site for learning web development for the beginners. 
This is the frontend repo of the project. 
[Link](https://github.com/Siddhant-Baranwal/webify_backend.git) to the backend repo.
[This](https://webify-gold.vercel.app/) is the actual site.

## Idea:
The basic idea of this website is to give the beginners a platform where they get the roadmap for full-stack web development. The user gets a 7 step roadmap for different tools of web-development. The user can click on that and see the useful videos and documentation for learning that tool, and also some videos for making a sample project using those and the previous tools.

## Implementation and Tech Stacks used:
The website is build on ReactJS. We have used different components for home page, navigation bar, counselling page and donate page.
